int solve(int x){return (sqrt(1+8*x)-1)/2;}//解方程?为何不打个表

# include <cstdio>
# include <cmath>
# include <cstring> 
using namespace std;
int n,k,m;unsigned long long ans;
int main(){
	scanf("%d%d",&k,&n);//进位正解好
	long long p=1;
	while(n){
		if(n&1) ans+=p;
		n>>=1;
		p*=k;
	}
	printf("%lld",ans);
	return 0;
